Algorithm Challenge #11 – Palindrome Number Checker
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This program reads a positive integer from the user and checks whether the number is a Palindrome—meaning it reads the same forward and backward.

This challenge strengthens your understanding of digit extraction, reversing numbers, input validation, and simple algorithmic logic in C++.

💡 What You’ll Learn
--
How to reverse digits of a number using modulo and division

How to compare between original and reversed numbers

How to validate user input

How to write clean and modular C++ functions

Logical thinking and algorithmic problem-solving

🧩 Example
--
Input:

Enter a positive number: 4554

Output:

Yes, it is a Palindrome Number.

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++

File Name: palindrome_number.cpp

Challenge Number: #11

💬 Notes
-
Palindrome problems are excellent for mastering number manipulation and control flow.
